# SourceLint: Source Vulnerability Detector

![SourceLint Logo](https://github.com/danushajithmal/FInal-Year-SourceLint/blob/main/Design/logo.png)

**Version**: 0.0.1  
**Description**: Detect vulnerabilities in JavaScript/TypeScript source code using static code analysis.

## Features

- **Static Code Analysis**: Uses pattern matching to detect potential vulnerabilities in the source code.
- **Reduced False Positives**: Specially crafted algorithms minimize the chances of false positive detection.
- **Special Rules**:
  - **Variable Rule**: Tracks and detects unsanitized user inputs to identify unsafe variable usage.
  - **File Upload Rule**: Examines file upload mechanisms to prevent harmful file uploads.
  - **Email Header Rule**: Checks email header sanitization for better security.
- **Covers Multiple Vulnerabilities**: Detects vulnerabilities including:
  - **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Mitigation Recommendations**: Provides mitigation recommendations for detected vulnerabilities.
- **Ignore Warnings**: User-friendly option to ignore specific warnings if needed.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Visual Studio Code version `^1.86.0` installed.

2. **Installing the Extension**:
   - Download the `source-vulnerability-detector` VSIX file (either via a marketplace or by packaging it locally).
   - Open Visual Studio Code, navigate to the Extensions sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac), click on the "..." menu, and choose `Install from VSIX...`.
   - Locate and select the VSIX file to install the extension.

3. **Running the Extension**:
   - Activate the extension by scanning your project for vulnerabilities:
     - **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac): Type and select `SourceLint: SourceLint`.
   - The extension will underline potential issues, and you can hover over them for more details and recommendations.

4. **Ignoring Warnings**:
   - If a warning is unnecessary or irrelevant, you can ignore it by using the `Ignore` option from the VS Code diagnostics panel. The warning will remain ignored until removed explicitly. When a code line is ignored the ignored codeline will be commented in the top of the codespace like `//Ignored Warning: #hashvalue`. You can remove the comment to revive back the ignored code.
